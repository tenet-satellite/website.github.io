              <h2>About The Event</h2>
              <p><b>Temporal networks</b> are powerful models for understanding dynamical systems where entities and interactions appear and vanish as time goes by.
                 Unlike static networks, which simply provide a snapshot of a system, temporal networks can provide insights into how the structure changes and how 
                 this affects network processes. Incorporating the <b>timing, order, and/or duration</b> of connections is critical in a wide range of applications, from routing traffic on mobility networks to predicting and hindering the spread of infectious diseases. 

                <br>Interest in temporal networks has grown rapidly across disciplines, fueled by advances in (big) data collection and computational tools. Despite significant progress, however, there is still much to be done to fully harness their potential.
                
                <br>At TENET (TEmporal NETworks), we welcome contributions to advancing temporal network research, focusing on novel methods, models, and applications. The satellite will bring together researchers from various disciplines to share innovative methodologies, theoretical advances, and empirical insights into how networks change, adapt, and respond to internal and external pressures.</p>

            <!-- <h5>Structures of toxic engagement on social media: Abusive messaging, content moderation, and deplatforming</h5>
            <p style="color: black;">There is broad concern about the potentially harmful nature of social media, especially in relation to the spread of mis- and disinformation, 
              and abusive messaging between individuals. However, many social media studies take a relatively narrow lens to understanding these issues, focusing often on only the US, 
              only English language content, or on only one social media platform (often Twitter or Reddit). In this talk I will discuss two recent studies which try to take small steps
               towards expanding the lens of social media research. First, I will discuss a study on social media deplatforming where we were able to track the migration of users from Twitter 
               to the US far-right Twitter clone Gettr, and were able to distinguish between those users migrating because they were banned from Twitter, and those who retained access to their Twitter accounts. 
               Second, I will discuss a study where we looked at the patterns of toxic messaging on Twitter across 9 countries and in 7 languages, highlighting the common and unique aspects of abusive in- and 
               out-group messaging between different political communities in different countries. Both studies align with my interest in bringing greater cross-platform and cross-country context to social media research.</p> -->

    <br><br>
    <h5><b>Contributed Talks</b></h5>  
    <h6><b>Deadline: <span>March 31, 2025</span> </b></h6>
    <p>
        For <b>contributed talks</b>, submissions will undergo single-blind peer review with a minimum of two reviewers per paper. 
        According to the main conference guidelines, all papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, 
        formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper,
        using Type 1 or TrueType fonts (available templates: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-authorkit25-anonymoussubmission/qxnjxxbvrjqr"> AAAI 2025 Author Kit on Overleaf </a>
         or <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit25/"> AAAI 2025 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]</a>).<br>
         Authors can submit either a <b>5-page short paper</b> 
        (with the fifth page reserved exclusively for references)
         presenting ongoing, unpublished work with experimental results, 
         which will be included in the workshop proceedings, or a <b>2-page abstract</b> (references not included in the page limit count)
         covering ongoing or published research (non-archival).</p>
         
      
          <h6>Submit your work via the CMT portal: <a

        <h5><b>Pitch Talks</b></h5>  
        <h6><b>Deadline: <span>June 16, 2025 (23.59 AoE)</span> </b></h6>
<p>The <b>pitch talks</b> session offers a dynamic, fast-paced format where researchers have two minutes to 
present their work and research identity. This innovative format welcomes both established researchers and 
newcomers to share their work at any stage - from published results to emerging ideas. 
Submissions for pitch talks are handled through a simple online form asking for a title and a very short abstract (<a
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4b4Aa9vHxYvTX-7PKabGY2vhirckkfkwAgrsLEv8n46OGbQ/viewform?usp=dialog">online form</a>) and <b>reviewed by the workshop organizers</b>. 
This format emphasizes engaging communication over technical depth, creating an energetic atmosphere as speakers present back-to-back. Authors whose 
works are not selected for contributed talks can be invited to participate in the pitch talks session.</p>
      



      
<h6><b>Fill the form for Pitch Talks: <a

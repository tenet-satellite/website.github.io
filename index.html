              <p>
                <b>Temporal networks</b> model systems where entities and interactions evolve over time. Unlike static networks, they capture how changing structures influence key processes by incorporating the <b>timing, order, and duration</b> of connections—crucial in applications ranging from mobility routing to disease spreading.
               
              Growing data availability and computational advances have accelerated interest in temporal networks, yet many challenges remain.
                <br><br>
                At TENET (TEmporal NETworks), we invite contributions that advance temporal network theory, methods, and applications. The satellite brings together researchers from diverse fields to explore how networks change, adapt, and respond to internal and external forces.

    <p>
      For <b>contributed talks</b>, submissions will undergo single-blind peer review with a minimum of two reviewers per paper.

      Submissions should be at most <b>one page</b> long in PDF format (including references and only one figure) and should include title, author(s), and affiliation(s). 
      Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will not be reviewed. Available template: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/netsci2026-abstract-template/pgyqyzcyvvdx"> [Latex] </a>

    <h5><b>Pitch Talks</b></h5>
    <h6><b>Deadline: <span>TBD</span></b></h6>
    <p>
      The <b>pitch talks</b> session offers a dynamic, fast-paced format where researchers have two minutes to
      present their work and research identity. This format welcomes both established researchers and
      newcomers to share their work at any stage – from published results to emerging ideas.
      Submissions for pitch talks are handled through a simple online form asking for a title and a very short abstract
      (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4b4Aa9vHxYvTX-7PKabGY2vhirckkfkwAgrsLEv8n46OGbQ/viewform?usp=dialog">online form</a>)
      and are <b>reviewed by the satellite organizers</b>.
      Each accepted pitch talk will also be assigned a <b>poster</b> during the satellite poster session.
      Authors whose works are not selected for contributed talks can be invited to participate in the pitch talks (with poster) session.

            <!-- <h5>Structures of toxic engagement on social media: Abusive messaging, content moderation, and deplatforming</h5>
            <p style="color: black;">There is broad concern about the potentially harmful nature of social media, especially in relation to the spread of mis- and disinformation, 
              and abusive messaging between individuals. However, many social media studies take a relatively narrow lens to understanding these issues, focusing often on only the US, 
              only English language content, or on only one social media platform (often Twitter or Reddit). In this talk I will discuss two recent studies which try to take small steps
               towards expanding the lens of social media research. First, I will discuss a study on social media deplatforming where we were able to track the migration of users from Twitter 
               to the US far-right Twitter clone Gettr, and were able to distinguish between those users migrating because they were banned from Twitter, and those who retained access to their Twitter accounts. 
               Second, I will discuss a study where we looked at the patterns of toxic messaging on Twitter across 9 countries and in 7 languages, highlighting the common and unique aspects of abusive in- and 
               out-group messaging between different political communities in different countries. Both studies align with my interest in bringing greater cross-platform and cross-country context to social media research.</p> -->
